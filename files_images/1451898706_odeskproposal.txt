Greetings ! My name is Prakash and i am an expert in PHP development . 
I would love to have the opportunity to discuss your project with you.

I have read your full project description and i understand your are looking for someone to work full time 
creating banner ad templates in Photoshop and is available Skype for all working hours.

In response to your question :-

1. I have been doing graphic design for over 10 years and have been a fulltime freelancer for 6.

2. I can start work within 2 days and will be able to complete the first milestone for the project within 1 business days.


To complete your initial project I would build a complex layered document that will enable different banner ads with different
element to be built with just a few clicks.You will hundreds of possible combinations!

Are you Okay with the project being done in Photoshop CC? I also have CS5 if you prefer.

Much of my experience comes from working for ABC Graphics which is a well-known graphic design company. I was their lead 
designer and this provided me with some very unique experties. For instance , I know that the right first step on this project
is to first speak with you about what you want to do with the banner ads so that i can create the layered file in the appropriate
manner.

I believe communication is key to any successfull project , and i 'd like to start things off on the right foot but suggesting
we schedule a phone or Skype call to discuss the project further. This will enable us to make sure we communicate well and that both 
parties are completely comfortable with the scope of the project.Please let me know a time that works best for you and i will
make sure that i make myself available.


Thanks you for your time and consideration. I look forward to working together on Odesk.

With Regards,
Prakash
