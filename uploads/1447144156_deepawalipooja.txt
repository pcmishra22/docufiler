1. On the night of Diwali, listen or read Vishnu Sahasra Naam and Shree Sukta
2. Purchase a new broom on Diwali and use it to clean the place where pooja has to be done. You can use it regularly from next day onwards. It will help in improving prosperity.
3. Try to offer homemade Rice or Sabudaana Kheer to Maa Lakshmi instead of offering sweets available in market.
4. If it is possible, have 11 Abhimantri “Gomti Chakra” and keep them in a red cloth bag. Treat these Gomti Chakra as Maa Lakshmi and worship them in your pooja. After doing pooja, you can keep these Gomti Chakras in your locker or almirah or the place where you keep your money. This will help you in gaining wealth and prosperity. People whose business is not growing must do this to gain benefit.
5. Most Important for all of you is to install a Crystal or Sphatik Shree Yantra on Diwali at your house. If you have this yantra, then after undertaking panchabhishek (washing with milk, ghee, honey, curd and gangajal) worship it. Maa Lakshmi resides in Shree Yantra and it will definitely bestow peace, happiness and blessings of Maa Lakshmi on you. 
6. There are many people who are facing unemployment or their want is always wandering here and there. They should wear Shree Yantra Abhimantrit Locket which will help them in gaining wealth and good intelligence. People who want to have promotion can also wear this locket or alternatively install Abhimantrit Shree Yantra at their house. 
7. If possible while doing Diwali Pooja wear Sphatik Bead mala. It will increase the effect of Diwali Pooja many times. Alternatively wear Lakshmi Narain Pendant which is a combination of Seven Mukhi and Ten Mukhi Rudraksha denoting Maa Lakshmi and Vishnu Ji respectively. 
8. On all days starting from Dhan Teras till Bhaiya Dhuj, try to light a diya near the Tulsi plant. Pushkar Puran states, “The person who lights the lamp of sesame (til) oil in the name of Lord Shri Hari in the month of Kartik (during Sandhya) gets unlimited prosperity, beauty, blessedness and wealth”. So if possible try to lit lamp of sesame (til) oil in evening during the whole month of Kartik (i.e. from 29th October 2012 to 28th November 2012).
